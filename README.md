This project is a dynamic dashboard that renders different data visualizations based on user-selected metrics.

The data is fetched using a mock JSON file to simulate API responses.

## Features

- **State Management**: Managed using **NgRx** for better state handling and scalability.
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes.
